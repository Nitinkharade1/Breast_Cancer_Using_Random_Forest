# Breast_Cancer_Using_Random_Forest

Sure, here is an example GitHub repository information that you can include in your repository:

### Repository Name: Breast Cancer Classification with Random Forest

### Description:
This repository contains code for a breast cancer classification model using the Random Forest algorithm. The model predicts whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA). The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from scikit-learn is used for training and testing the model.

### Overview:
This project aims to build a predictive model for breast cancer classification using the Random Forest algorithm. The implementation is done in Python, and the code is available in both a script (`breast_cancer_random_forest.py`) and a Jupyter Notebook (`Breast_Cancer_Classification.ipynb`).

### Dataset:
The model utilizes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from scikit-learn. This dataset contains various features computed from FNA images, and the target variable indicates whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

### Requirements:
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-random-forest.git
cd breast-cancer-random-forest
```

2. Run the code:

```bash
python breast_cancer_random_forest.py
```

Explore the Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis and results.

### File Structure:
- `breast_cancer_random_forest.py`: Python script with the Random Forest model implementation.
- `Breast_Cancer_Classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for exploration, implementation, and analysis.

### Results:
The model achieves an accuracy of [your_accuracy] on the test set.
